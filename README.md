To set up your own deployment:

1. Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
   - `HOST`: Your server's hostname or IP address
   - `USERNAME`: SSH username
   - `SSHKEY`: SSH private key
   - `PORT`: SSH port (usually 22)
   - `SERVER_FOLDER`: Target directory on the server

2. Push to the main branch to trigger the deployment.
