            <h2>👨🏻‍💻 Hello !</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, everyone! Welcome to my blog. I'm Remy, and I'm thrilled
                to have you here. In this short presentation, I'd like to
                introduce myself and share a bit about who I am and what I'm
                passionate about.
            </p>
            <h3>Who am I ?</h3>
            <p>
                I am {age} years old. Born in Dijon (France) where I'm currently
                pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. Additionally, I am
                working as an intern in a company related to my Master's degree.
            </p>
            <h3>Why this blog ?</h3>
            <p>
                I want to enhance my ability to write and share articles about
                topics I find personally intriguing and that I believe are worth
                sharing.
            </p>
            <h3>What I would like to share ?</h3>
            <p>
                I'd like to mention my homelab, which I plan to discuss in an
                upcoming blog post, along with some projects that I'll delve
                into at a later time.
