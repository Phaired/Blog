## 1. Introduction

This project, undertaken as part of the Algorithmics and Complexity module, involves implementing a steganography algorithm in OCaml with message encryption using the RSA algorithm.

Steganography is the practice of hiding information within an inconspicuous medium. In this project, the algorithm hides a text message within a `.ppm` image. This method is widely used for covert communication, as the message is virtually indistinguishable from its medium unless its existence is known.

The hidden message is also encrypted using the RSA algorithm to ensure its security. RSA is based on asymmetric encryption: a key pair is generated, consisting of a private key known only to the intended recipient for decrypting the message, and a public key used for encrypting the message, which is publicly available. This allows anyone to encrypt a message, but only the holder of the private key can decrypt it.

## 2. Initial Analysis

One method to discreetly encode the message into the image is by embedding the message into the least significant bits of each color channel of each pixel. This allows encoding 3 bits of data per pixel. A pixel represents 3 colors (RGB), each encoded with 8 bits, totaling 24 bits per pixel. Thus, a 100x100 pixel image can accommodate 30,000 bits of data.

![Figure 1.1](/projects/steganography/leastbit.png)

_Figure 1.1: Modification of the least significant bit for each pixel._

One initial approach for encoding the message, given its variable length, is to read the entire image: this ensures retrieval of the entire message in all cases, but the message will contain noise after its end (unaltered least significant bits). An improvement would be to write/read only up to the message length.

This is the approach chosen. A 30-bit header (10 pixels) containing the message length is implemented in the encoding/decoding section, allowing the message to be retrieved without scanning the entire image. This results in a complexity of O(n), where _n_ is the message length.

To ensure message security, it is encrypted with RSA. The encrypted message is converted to bits before embedding to best fit the image requirements.

## 3. Encoding in the Image

A Portable Bitmap Format (PPM) image is a simple, uncompressed image structure containing a header with 3 lines:

- Image type indicating if the image is binary or ASCII; we use the binary type `P6`.
- Image width and height.
- Maximum value for each color (255 in this case).

Following the header, each pixel's RGB values are listed.

The message length is converted to a 30-bit binary string (10 pixels). The message length is added to the first 10 pixels of the image, indicating where to stop during decoding.

### 3.1 Construction of the Complete Message

The message consists of the header containing the message length and the RSA-encrypted message converted to binary.

### 3.2 Writing into the Image

Each bit of the message is sequentially inserted into the least significant bit of each color byte of the image, overwriting the last bit with the corresponding message bit. The image is first loaded into memory, modified with the message length, and then saved as `output.ppm`.

### 3.3 Code Presentation

```ocaml
(* Function to overwrite the last bit of a byte with a specified bit *)
let overwrite_last_bit byte message_bit =
  match message_bit with
  | '1' -> byte lor 1 (* Set the last bit to 1 *)
  | '0' -> byte land 0xFE (* Set the last bit to 0 *)
  | _ -> failwith "Message bit must be '0' or '1'"
```

```ocaml
(* Function to insert a message into a PPM image file *)
let insert_message file_path message =
  let ic = open_in_bin file_path in
  let oc = open_out_bin "output.ppm" in
  (* Read and rewrite the PPM header *)
  let (width, height, max_val) = read_header ic in
  Printf.fprintf oc "P6\n%d %d\n%s\n" width height max_val;
  (* Calculate total image data size *)
  let image_size = width * height * 3 in
  let buffer = Bytes.create image_size in
  really_input ic buffer 0 image_size; (* Load image into buffer *)
  let binary_message = string_to_binary message in
  let binary_length = int_to_fixed_length_binary 30 message_length in
  (* Concatenate message length and the message itself *)
  let full_message = binary_length ^ binary_message in
  let message_index = ref 0 in
  (* Iterate over each byte and insert message bits *)
  for i = 0 to image_size - 1 do
    if !message_index < String.length full_message then
      let byte = Char.code (Bytes.get buffer i) in
      let msg_bit = full_message.[!message_index] in
      incr message_index; (* Move to the next message bit *)
      Bytes.set buffer i (Char.chr (overwrite_last_bit byte msg_bit));
  done;
  (* Write the modified buffer to the output file *)
  output_bytes oc buffer;
  (* Close the files *)
  close_in ic;
  close_out oc
```

### 3.4 Complexity

#### Complexity of `overwrite_last_bit` Function

The `overwrite_last_bit` function modifies the last bit of a byte based on the provided bit ('0' or '1'). It uses a basic logical operation (AND or OR), executed in constant time.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1), as it performs a comparison and a binary operation regardless of input size.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of space with no additional space required based on input size.

#### Complexity of the Byte Processing Loop

The loop iterates over each byte of the image to insert the encoded message bits, with complexity primarily dependent on the number of bytes in the image.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where _n_ is the total number of bytes in the image (width × height × 3). Each iteration calls `overwrite_last_bit`, which runs in constant time, making the total time linear with respect to _n_.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The loop uses a constant amount of space for variables like byte index and bit index, independent of image size or message length.

## 4. Message Encryption with RSA

RSA encryption is an asymmetric cryptographic system using a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, RSA is widely used to secure sensitive data.

For our RSA implementation, we based it on the repository available on GitHub:[RSA-by-OCaml](https://github.com/MingLLuo/RSA-by-OCaml). This repository provided a solid foundation for implementing RSA in OCaml.

### 4.1 Key Generation

Key generation involves the following steps:

1. **Choose Prime Numbers:** Select two large distinct prime numbers, _p_ and _q_.

2. **Calculate _n_:** Compute $n = p \times q$. This $n$ is used in both keys.

3. **Calculate Euler's Totient Function $\phi(n)$:**

    $$
    \phi(n) = (p - 1) \times (q - 1)
    $$

4. **Choose Public Exponent _e_:**  
   Choose $e$ such that $1 < e < \phi(n)$ and $\gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1$. A common choice for $e$ is $65537$.

5. **Calculate Private Exponent _d_:** $d$ is the modular inverse of $e$ modulo $\phi(n)$, meaning

    $$
    d \times e \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}
    $$

### 4.2 Keys

- **Public Key:** Composed of $(n, e)$.

- **Private Key:** Composed of $(n, d)$.

### 4.3 Encryption and Decryption

- **Encryption:** To encrypt a message _m_ (where _m_ is an integer smaller than _n_), compute:

$$ c = m^e \mod n $$

where _c_ is the ciphertext.

- **Decryption:** To decrypt _c_ using the private key:

$$ m = c^d \mod n $$

where _m_ is the original message.

### 4.4 Security

The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring _n_ into its prime components _p_ and _q_. The size of _n_ (typically several hundred bits) makes this task infeasible with current technology. However, proper implementation is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities, including careful selection of _p_, _q_, and _e_ to avoid potential attacks.

### 4.5 Code Presentation

The RSA-related code is located in the first appendix.

#### Key Generation (`private_key_gen`)

```ocaml
(* Generate the private key *)
let private_key_gen rc =
  let p = prime_gen rc.p_len in
  let q = prime_gen rc.q_len in
  let phi = Z.mul (Z.sub p Z.one) (Z.sub q Z.one) in
  let e = e_gen rc phi in
  let d = d_gen e phi in
  { n = Z.mul p q; p; q; e; d }
```

#### Encryption (`plaintext_encrypt`)

```ocaml
(* Encrypt plaintext using the public key *)
let plaintext_encrypt pt (pk : public_key) =
  let c = Z.powm pt.message pk.e pk.n in
  { c = c; types = pt.types }
```

### 4.6 Encryption and Decryption

Encryption and decryption processes involve converting the message into an integer, performing modular exponentiation, and handling the encryption and decryption operations as described above.

### 4.7 Utilities and Miscellaneous Operations

- **Coprimality Test (`coprime`):** Checks if two numbers are coprime by computing their GCD.
- **Serialization and File Writing:** Converts data structures into string format and writes them to files for later use.

### 4.8 Complexity

#### Key Generation

- **Prime Generation (`prime_gen`):** Uses the Miller-Rabin primality test, a probabilistic algorithm. The time complexity is dominated by modular exponentiations, denoted as O(k · log³ n), where _k_ is the number of trials and _n_ is the number being tested.
- **Private Key Generation (`private_key_gen`):** Involves calculating _n = p × q_ and ϕ = (p−1)(q−1), followed by determining the private exponent _d_ via modular inversion, with a complexity of O(log² n).

#### Encryption and Decryption

- **Encryption (`plaintext_encrypt`):** Utilizes modular exponentiation with a time complexity of O(log _e_), where _e_ is the public exponent, typically chosen to be small to optimize speed.

#### Miscellaneous Operations

- **Coprimality Test (`coprime`):** Implements GCD calculation with logarithmic time complexity relative to the input sizes.
- **Serialization and File Writing:** Involves I/O operations that may impact performance based on the file system used.

## 6. Conclusion

Through this report, we explored steganography and asymmetric encryption using RSA to encrypt and hide a message within an image without altering its appearance. The before and after insertion of the message into the image can be seen in Appendix 2, Figure 1.4.

Although RSA was covered in the cryptography course, we encountered it just before the project deadline. Understanding and implementing the principles of steganography was intriguing and educational. However, the syntax barrier and the learning curve of OCaml posed challenges rather than aiding in the project’s realization.
